## üßê Learning Objects

- **What is a binary tree**
- **What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree**
- **What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists**
- **What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree**
- **What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree**
- **What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree**
